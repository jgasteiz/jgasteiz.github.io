<div class="blog-post__content"><p>Last Wednesday I got good news at <a href="https://p.ota.to">Potato</a>: I've been promoted to senior developer :)</p>
<p>It's been roughly a year since I decided to ask for more responsibilities at work - tech leading small things at first, big ones until now - and it seems I've been doing things well (or so I've been told).</p>
<p>The reason I decided to ask for it was that I was going to get more variety of work than if I decided to stay the way I was. Which wasn't bad, but most of the times I felt like I wasn't being challenged and I really thought I could do more. Since then I've been lucky enough to work on Android and Arduino related stuff, tech lead a couple of short projects and more recently being the tech lead of a big team (oscillating between 6 and 8 people).</p>
<p>I think I could have got the promotion a bit earlier if I had pushed for it a bit more, but I really didn't want to rush it. Rushing it would have meant forcing myself to learn things faster and I think this is one of those things it's better learnt slowly.</p>
<p>The main difference I've noticed during the last year is that I now have to deal with people much more than I used to: people will ask you questions which answers you won't always know and figuring out how to solve these situations is, most of the times, a lot of fun.</p></div>
