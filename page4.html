<span class="blog-post__date">Saturday, 24 September 2016</span>
</div>
<div class="blog-post__content"><p>It's been almost a week since we came back from this year's PotatoCon, so it's time to write something about it.</p>
<p>Every year gets harder and harder to tell which PotatoCon has been the best. They are all special in their own way. This has been my fourth PotatoCon, but the first one in Europe – being the previous ones in USA (twice) and Thailand – and they couldn't have picked a better location.</p>
<p>I'm going to highlight two things from this year's PotatoCon.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It's great being able to talk to colleagues I normally don't get the chance to talk to. There are truly amazing people in this company. I only regret not having talked to more of them! It's also impressive the fact everyone gets along with everyone. And even more impressive taking into account we were sixty four Potatoes this year. I guess we only hire nice people :).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The food. Oh god, the food was amazing. We were extremely lucky we were in an amazing hotel and absolutely all the food they made in there was incredible. Even the dishes that are not typical from the Canary Islands. Food is definitely in the top 3 of "things I miss from Spain".</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, some pictures of the adventure:</p>

<p>We were drinking lots of cava while watching the sun going down.</p>

<p>A couple of days later we went on a boat trip. Which is becoming a tradition, this is my third boat trip in a PotatoCon so far.</p>
<p><img alt="Boat trip" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/vSlFR8jjGGaO3Gb_1hpm3GTnsOM4xPuO9RZl4gWm4IqeXghK9xvQG3ioHlPEgFchdQZnkLKw5GbEKw=w1600"/></p>
<p>It was actually a boat party. The theme was "Pirates!". But it was hot and most of the people undressed pretty quickly.</p>

<p>The last day we went to a pretty awesome water park, but I obviously left my phone in the lockers and there are no pictures/proof of that.</p>
<p>To end this post, here's a time-lapse a colleague made watching the sunset in the Teide National Park, at around 2200m.</p>

<h1 class="blog-post__title"><a href="password-managers.html">Password Managers</a></h1>
<span class="blog-post__date">Saturday, 03 September 2016</span>
</div>
<div class="blog-post__content"><h2>The problem</h2>
<p>For years, I've been the kind of person who always used the same three or four passwords for every single online service I used to have. Every time one of these services <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">got hacked</a>, I was supposed to change the password I was using for that service and in every other service I was using that password. Obviously, I wasn't keeping track of that, so I used to miss many of them.</p>
<p>Then 2-factor authentication* came to be and I started activating it for every service I considered important: Google, Amazon, Twitter, Facebook, Dropbox, Github, Gitlab... That made me feel much safer. But it had a couple of inconveniences:</p>
<ol>
<li>Not every service offers 2-factor authentication and not all of them would offer the SMS one, which is the one I chose.</li>
<li>I would need my UK phone number with me all the time – this is a problem four or five times per year, when I go to Spain and Poland.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>2 Factor Authentication it's an extra layer of security that relies not only on the common user/password combination, but also on something you have with you. Most of the times, it's either an app on your phone generating security codes for the extra login step or this same kind of codes, but sent to you via SMS.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite of that, I got used to it and it felt safe enough. At least for the last three years or so.</p>
<p>Then a few days ago I got another email from Dropbox, saying I need to change my password (again) because <a href="https://blogs.dropbox.com/dropbox/2016/08/resetting-passwords-to-keep-your-files-safe/">millions of account credentials have been leaked (again)</a>. That got me a bit upset, so I finally decided to start looking for a better way of dealing with passwords.</p>
<h2>The solution</h2>
<p>I learnt from password managers two or three years ago, when I saw a workmate using one in the office. I didn't remember the name, but I did remember how the icon looked like. It turned out to be <a href="https://1password.com/">1Password</a>. I checked it out and it was offering – still is – a free six month trial period, which should be more than enough time to use it extensively. So I signed up. They also have some cool information explaining <a href="https://1password.com/security/">how it works in the security section</a>.</p>
<p>I've changed every password in every single online service I've used for the last 5 days and updated every single 2-factor auth code to use the 1Password app rather than my phone - equivalent of using Google Authenticator, for instance.</p>
<p>I have to say that apart from the pain of changing every password, using this tool feels great. And it definitely makes me feel safer. Now every password I'm using is different: they are long, hard to remember, don't make any sense and combine symbols and numbers. Perfect passwords!</p>
<p>I will complain about one thing though: using it on a phone or tablet is not a great experience. You need to switch context to grab a particular password and then come back to the login screen to enter it. And if you have 2-factor authentication activated, it will mean an extra change of context – that would be 4 changes to get through a login form. There are a couple of apps that integrate their login forms with 1Password and make the experience much better, but that's still a small number of apps.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>If you are concerned about your security, get yourself a password manager or a service that will make you create secure passwords.</p>

<h1 class="blog-post__title"><a href="just-married.html">Just married</a></h1>
<span class="blog-post__date">Saturday, 09 July 2016</span>
</div>
<div class="blog-post__content"><p>Two weeks ago, actually. After almost three weeks in Poland, we're finally back home. I have to say I've missed it a bit. It's been great taking so many days off, being with friends and family and taking days off in general. But it's been hectic. We haven't really stopped doing things for a single day until now.</p>
<p>So, what's like being married? Not much has changed, really. Magda has now a new surname, but that's mostly it.</p>
<p>It's hard to believe how things used to be 30 years ago. My parents, for instance, weren't living together before getting married. Which means they didn't know how life together was going to be until after getting married, such a commitment! Our thing is easy, Magda and I have been living together for almost 3 years now, we (kind of) knew what we were doing.</p>
<p>We decided we wouldn't go on our honeymoon straight after the wedding, but a few months after, to Japan. I'm really looking forward to it. Now we <em>only</em> have to start organising the trip!</p>
<p>Anyway, I leave you a couple of pictures we took the week after the wedding. Thanks to Magda's cousin for taking them!</p>
