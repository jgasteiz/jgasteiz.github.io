<div class="blog-post__content"><p>In the past few months I've noticed I'm barely able to write anything on a paper. My calligraphy has gone to shit since I left uni and at this pace I'm going to have to relearn how to write.</p>
<p>The only thing I've been able to come up with to avoid that is to start having a pocket todo diary, instead of using Todoist (sorry, Todoist). Hopefully, by writing a bit every day I will soon remember how to do it.</p>
<p>I guess this is a classic 21st century problem.</p></div>

<p>Just came back from the yearly Potato offsite and this year was in Phuket (Thailand).</p>
<p>This was my second time this year (and in my life too) in Thailand and both trips couldn't have been more different. Not in a bad way at all, they were actually great in their own way: the first one was very active and this one was extremely relaxing – just what we needed anyway. Most of the pictures I took are sunsets, beaches and swimming pools so there's not much to show, unfortunately.</p>
<p><img alt="Swimming pool" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/o3O8MS5ERA4tad006P1V2AquY1wzdDw857GZL6SvCuir8Pr9bBl8=w800"/></p>
<p>Something you usually assume before going to a <a href="https://p.ota.to/">Potato</a> offsite is that "no matter where it is, you'll have a great time". There's such a good vibe between all of us that we would have fun even in Reading – no disrespect, Reading.</p>
<p>It's great to be part of this family. To many more years!</p>

<span class="blog-post__date">Saturday, 18 July 2015</span>

<div class="blog-post__content"><p>Exactly today it's been two months since I went to the USA (Mountain View and San Francisco) for a couple of weeks to work on a project. And I realised, just now, I didn't leave anywhere any record of it. Unfortunately, I can't tell what I was working on, but I can assure it was some good software and hardware fun.</p>
<p>One good thing I got from this trip is some reassurance of how much I like the UK. Despite of how lovely everyone I met there was, I just can't live with the fact that everything is so damn far. It doesn't matter where you want to go, it'll be far and you'll need a car to get there.</p>
<p>Some pictures from Mountain View:</p>
<p><img alt="Old Google Logo" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/09w7KxQFCv3p6l87uafOCZXdFVhs5dS8sHnhz-DnUuAif93JxLL6=w800"/>
<em>The Old Google Logo</em></p>

<em>Some delicious sushi in front of our hotel, in Mountain View</em></p>
<p><img alt="Google bikes" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/VSCLFOOz0dpTMBDsltCta9feBCv0D6XGw3JoSrtSiGvtB-CXNjy8=w800"/><br/>
<em>Google bikes, probably what I liked most from Google Campus</em></p>
<p><img alt="Google Self driving cars" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/qlR-ROWBuiSEhNXnnkpWyh8HYEqx7cqYFqWFPyHJiA_Lkvk8l7NM=w800"/><br/>
<em>We saw a few of them, several times</em></p>
<p>In our day off, we visited the Computer History Museum. Very interesting stuff.</p>
<p><img alt="Apple 1" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/RGRQ-LSjCKp6LrX-xuz-lNLswWpvv70V53HrXNIubbh9=w800"/><br/>
<em>The Apple 1, signed by Steve Wozniak</em></p>
<p>And not much more to show from there, we were quite busy. We spent around ten days in Mountain View, then we moved to San Francisco.</p>
<p>Now some pictures from San Francisco.</p>
<p><img alt="The Hotel Lobby" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/hpXzX7szbD0vHfvZgs_DsariZxEf2lWG2W1jWR-5o4L1=w800"/><br/>
<em>We stayed in quite a fancy place, The Clift</em></p>

<em>Nice sofas in the lobby</em></p>
<p>I'd add some Google IO pictures, but I can't really find any interesting ones! On the other hand, here's a video of the first day post Google IO party. Very cool.</p>

<p>Ah right, I forgot about this one!</p>

<em>I played for a while, it turned out quite fun!</em></p>
<p>And that was pretty much it, I came back home truly exhausted. Great experience overall with its ups and downs (mostly ups, to be fair). Hopefully I'll have the chance to get into another project overseas again.</p></div>
