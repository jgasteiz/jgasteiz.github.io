<p>In the past few months I've noticed I'm barely able to write anything on a paper. My calligraphy has gone to shit since I left uni and at this pace I'm going to have to relearn how to write.</p>
<p>The only thing I've been able to come up with to avoid that is to start having a pocket todo diary, instead of using Todoist (sorry, Todoist). Hopefully, by writing a bit every day I will soon remember how to do it.</p>
<p>I guess this is a classic 21st century problem.</p></div>

<p>Just came back from the yearly Potato offsite and this year was in Phuket (Thailand).</p>
<p>This was my second time this year (and in my life too) in Thailand and both trips couldn't have been more different. Not in a bad way at all, they were actually great in their own way: the first one was very active and this one was extremely relaxing – just what we needed anyway. Most of the pictures I took are sunsets, beaches and swimming pools so there's not much to show, unfortunately.</p>
<p><img alt="Swimming pool" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/o3O8MS5ERA4tad006P1V2AquY1wzdDw857GZL6SvCuir8Pr9bBl8=w800"/></p>
<p>Something you usually assume before going to a <a href="https://p.ota.to/">Potato</a> offsite is that "no matter where it is, you'll have a great time". There's such a good vibe between all of us that we would have fun even in Reading – no disrespect, Reading.</p>
<p>It's great to be part of this family. To many more years!</p>

<div class="blog-post__content"><p>Date: 2015-07-18</p>
<p>Exactly today it's been two months since I went to the USA (Mountain View and San Francisco) for a couple of weeks to work on a project. And I realised, just now, I didn't leave anywhere any record of it. Unfortunately, I can't tell what I was working on, but I can assure it was some good software and hardware fun.</p>
<p>One good thing I got from this trip is some reassurance of how much I like the UK. Despite of how lovely everyone I met there was, I just can't live with the fact that everything is so damn far. It doesn't matter where you want to go, it'll be far and you'll need a car to get there.</p>
<p>Some pictures from Mountain View:</p>

<em>We saw a few of them, several times</em></p>
<p>In our day off, we visited the Computer History Museum. Very interesting stuff.</p>

<em>The Apple 1, signed by Steve Wozniak</em></p>
<p>And not much more to show from there, we were quite busy. We spent around ten days in Mountain View, then we moved to San Francisco.</p>
<p>Now some pictures from San Francisco.</p>

<em>Nice sofas in the lobby</em></p>
<p>I'd add some Google IO pictures, but I can't really find any interesting ones! On the other hand, here's a video of the first day post Google IO party. Very cool.</p>

<em>I played for a while, it turned out quite fun!</em></p>
<p>And that was pretty much it, I came back home truly exhausted. Great experience overall with its ups and downs (mostly ups, to be fair). Hopefully I'll have the chance to get into another project overseas again.</p></div>

<div class="blog-post__content"><p>Date: 2015-05-05</p>
<p>This last weekend Magda and I went west to visit Bristol and it was seriously good. Good enough to convince ourselves Bristol could be a good place to live for the following years.</p>
<p><img alt="Suspension bridge" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Vo29gO8zrgf-bvIUo0WQSVLhy7iOtJD0fc4qbaQdYN6sBJ8WLtU1=w800"/>
<em>Very cool suspension bridge</em></p>
<p>We were lucky enough to go for the same weekend <a href="http://www.bristolfoodconnections.com/">Food Connections</a> was taking place. Lots of stands serving delicious food and drinks. We even found a Spanish one, serving paella, tapas and sangría. Apart from that, many Bristol City FC supporters came out to receive the team, which has recently achieved... some achievements.</p>
<p>We stayed in a local hotel which couldn't remind me more of <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/fawltytowers/index.shtml">Fawlty Towers</a>. Lovely staff, but old old old everything else. Good price for value, though. It was in the south of Clifton, beautiful neighborhood. We found it a bit posh, something our Bristol friends confirmed afterwards.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, on our first day there we got the weirdest weather we could have got. One third drizzle, one third wind, one third sun and two fifths rain – it didn't make any sense.</p>
<p><img alt="Queen Square" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/gIOKUNfhR5PIe4Npakfg75otA9i18mwNGfwhuucRmTEzp3MUlIsM=w800"/>

<em>Yeah, they all live in tents over there.</em></p>
<p>We'll definitely come back at some point during or after Summer. We want to explore more.</p></div>

<p>Yes, I also thought this blog was dead. It's not like I didn't have anything to write about, I've actually done a lot of things during these last five months. I don't really have an excuse for not writing.</p>
<p>Remembering all the stuff will be easier with the help of some pictures, so here it goes.</p>
<h3>September</h3>
<p>The first half of September was so quiet, the second half was a complete madness to compensate. During exactly 2 weeks, I spent the first five days in Poland – my first Polish wedding – and the last ten in the USA, with Potato.</p>
<p><img alt="vodka" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-N7NRbsHI0hs/VNETyDUzdFI/AAAAAAAATKo/ct1tktLs04I/w800-h533-no/IMG_6419-sm.jpg"/></p>
<p><em>Dancing and sweating is as important as drinking during a Polish wedding, if not more.</em></p>
<p><img alt="drugs" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-cHIDnI1rp3Y/VB_mUDfESpI/AAAAAAAAQhA/8hIQakrSRd8/w837-h628-no/IMG_20140919_214744.jpg"/></p>
<p><em>And because vodka was really good quality, this wasn't really necessary.</em></p>
<p>The Potato offsite went over all expectations. This year there was not only one destination, but three: Santa Monica, Las Vegas and Palm Springs, in that order. The first stop offered a good balance of party possibilities, beach and relax. Vegas was a big rollercoaster to our bodies and brains. And Palm Springs was probably the only possible way we had to calm ourselves down before coming back.</p>
<p>Pics!</p>

<p><em>'Murica! Breakfast in Santa Monica</em></p>

<p><em>Party Bus - getting on any bus hasn't been the same since then.</em></p>
<p><img alt="Vegas Baby!" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/i2uBQwZv3V1GwP2jFlac4eNXDU90krZf0Y47hqIWV7IG=w446-h628-no"/></p>
<p><em>Yes.</em></p>
<p><img alt="Palm Springs" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-uAO75VUmagY/VCl9lISpceI/AAAAAAAAQ9o/NkI38s0yczI/w1118-h628-no/IMG_20140928_092248964.jpg"/></p>
<p><em>Palm Springs, such a nice desertic views.</em></p>
<p>With a few extra pounds in our bellies and a <em>never-seen-before</em> jet lag, I somehow manage to start working on my second day back in London.</p>
<h3>October</h3>
<p>Pretty much nothing here. The offsite left my brain half dead for 80% of the month and the only thing I remember from this month is the Halloween pumpkins we carved.</p>
<p><img alt="Pumpkins" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Zvj_gnj35Sw/VEvihnJMk3I/AAAAAAAARMw/aB_Gi9R_5B8/w1118-h628-no/IMG_20141025_184839911.jpg"/></p>
<h3>November</h3>
<p>This is when I start feeling interested in unconventional literature.</p>
<p><img alt="what if?" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-8-EcD2qjv80/VFi5GXoWVjI/AAAAAAAARZk/saTQbdkgtLc/w471-h628-no/IMG_20141104_113132.jpg"/></p>
<p><em>Back cover of Randall Munroe's <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/What-If-Scientific-Hypothetical-Questions/dp/1848549571/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1422988960&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=what+if%3F">"what if?"</a>.</em></p>
<p>I also added other titles to my library such as <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Diary-Edward-Hamster-1990/dp/075222803X">"Diary of Edward the hamster"</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Terrible-Estate-Agent-Photos-Donaldson/dp/0224100912/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1422988914&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Terrible+estate+agent+photos">"Terrible estate agent photos"</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Film-Five-Seconds-Great-Moments/dp/1848662963">"Film in five seconds"</a>.</p>
<p>And finally some friends decide to make me a visit in London!</p>
<p><img alt="Maikel and JC" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-56eaSBMoaPA/VGDTdkfzLgI/AAAAAAAARko/QPQM1p0cF3w/w837-h628-no/C360_2014-11-10-14-06-15-983.jpg"/></p>
<h3>December</h3>
<p>Mostly Christmas. It's everywhere. Also, I start getting my hands seriously dirty with Android and Arduino. I publish a couple of (still very simple) apps in the Play Store, which made me spend a lot of spare time learning Android. And most important! I'll get married on June 2016 (yes, 2016, still a year and a half to go) :) Yes, I've deliberately hidden this info here so only friends will actually notice it – who else would read this post anyway?</p>

<p><em>Pretty shite right now, but this app in particular stays as simple as I need it for my daily usage.</em></p>

<p><em>Jesus C.</em></p>
<h3>January</h3>
<p>Back in Vitoria for 10 days. There's Jamón and Chorizo everywhere, such a porky paradise. As usual during Christmas, I get to see all those people I only see once a year.</p>
<p><img alt="Friends" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-UYYap5uc6ok/VKkWVgECfTI/AAAAAAAASeQ/9cbZ6NFiLjw/w837-h628-no/IMG_20150103_224840.jpg"/></p>
<p>And finally, I get back to London to find out my flat electricity is totally screwed. This is the hole they dug in front of my flat.</p>
<p><img alt="hole" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-GDdsDPncr80/VLlZbyqIr3I/AAAAAAAASnc/hEerwuBtnnE/w471-h628-no/2015-01-16.jpg"/></p></div>
