<p>Just came back from the yearly Potato offsite and this year was in Phuket (Thailand).</p>
<p>This was my second time this year (and in my life too) in Thailand and both trips couldn't have been more different. Not in a bad way at all, they were actually great in their own way: the first one was very active and this one was extremely relaxing – just what we needed anyway. Most of the pictures I took are sunsets, beaches and swimming pools so there's not much to show, unfortunately.</p>
<p><img alt="Swimming pool" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/o3O8MS5ERA4tad006P1V2AquY1wzdDw857GZL6SvCuir8Pr9bBl8=w800"/></p>
<p>Something you usually assume before going to a <a href="https://p.ota.to/">Potato</a> offsite is that "no matter where it is, you'll have a great time". There's such a good vibe between all of us that we would have fun even in Reading – no disrespect, Reading.</p>
<p>It's great to be part of this family. To many more years!</p>

<h1 class="blog-post__title"><a href="mountain-view-san-francisco-2015.html">Mountain View &amp; San Francisco 2015</a></h1>
<span class="blog-post__date">Saturday, 18 July 2015</span>
</div>
<div class="blog-post__content"><p>Exactly today it's been two months since I went to the USA (Mountain View and San Francisco) for a couple of weeks to work on a project. And I realised, just now, I didn't leave anywhere any record of it. Unfortunately, I can't tell what I was working on, but I can assure it was some good software and hardware fun.</p>
<p>One good thing I got from this trip is some reassurance of how much I like the UK. Despite of how lovely everyone I met there was, I just can't live with the fact that everything is so damn far. It doesn't matter where you want to go, it'll be far and you'll need a car to get there.</p>
<p>Some pictures from Mountain View:</p>

<em>The Old Google Logo</em></p>

<em>Some delicious sushi in front of our hotel, in Mountain View</em></p>

<em>Google bikes, probably what I liked most from Google Campus</em></p>

<em>We saw a few of them, several times</em></p>
<p>In our day off, we visited the Computer History Museum. Very interesting stuff.</p>

<em>The Apple 1, signed by Steve Wozniak</em></p>
<p>And not much more to show from there, we were quite busy. We spent around ten days in Mountain View, then we moved to San Francisco.</p>
<p>Now some pictures from San Francisco.</p>

<em>Nice sofas in the lobby</em></p>
<p>I'd add some Google IO pictures, but I can't really find any interesting ones! On the other hand, here's a video of the first day post Google IO party. Very cool.</p>

<p>Ah right, I forgot about this one!</p>

<em>I played for a while, it turned out quite fun!</em></p>
<p>And that was pretty much it, I came back home truly exhausted. Great experience overall with its ups and downs (mostly ups, to be fair). Hopefully I'll have the chance to get into another project overseas again.</p></div>

<h1 class="blog-post__title"><a href="visiting-bristol.html">Visiting Bristol</a></h1>
<span class="blog-post__date">Tuesday, 05 May 2015</span>
</div>
<div class="blog-post__content"><p>This last weekend Magda and I went west to visit Bristol and it was seriously good. Good enough to convince ourselves Bristol could be a good place to live for the following years.</p>
<p><img alt="Suspension bridge" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Vo29gO8zrgf-bvIUo0WQSVLhy7iOtJD0fc4qbaQdYN6sBJ8WLtU1=w800"/>
<em>Very cool suspension bridge</em></p>
<p>We were lucky enough to go for the same weekend <a href="http://www.bristolfoodconnections.com/">Food Connections</a> was taking place. Lots of stands serving delicious food and drinks. We even found a Spanish one, serving paella, tapas and sangría. Apart from that, many Bristol City FC supporters came out to receive the team, which has recently achieved... some achievements.</p>
<p>We stayed in a local hotel which couldn't remind me more of <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/fawltytowers/index.shtml">Fawlty Towers</a>. Lovely staff, but old old old everything else. Good price for value, though. It was in the south of Clifton, beautiful neighborhood. We found it a bit posh, something our Bristol friends confirmed afterwards.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, on our first day there we got the weirdest weather we could have got. One third drizzle, one third wind, one third sun and two fifths rain – it didn't make any sense.</p>

<p><img alt="indian tents" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/3AU2Bvn7yro1QAabZCNTD9aGZDXNkCeBZlHCDPm-pWgSJE92cv2C=w800"/>
<em>Yeah, they all live in tents over there.</em></p>
<p>We'll definitely come back at some point during or after Summer. We want to explore more.</p></div>
