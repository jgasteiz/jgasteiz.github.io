<div class="blog-post__content"><p>I'm back (alive!) from Amsterdam. A few weeks ago, some friends and I decided it could be fun to spend a weekend partying and discovering the city of Amsterdam. And it's been great.</p>
<h3>The canals</h3>
<p>One of the things people are scared about when they go with this kind of purposes to Amsterdam is falling to the canals. I'm not aware if that's something that happens often, but it didn't happen to us. And I have to say they give a beautiful look to the city.</p>
<p><img alt="The canals" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-tjGhma4btMU/U6dq0X3duDI/AAAAAAAAPfM/LeszwHXrNAg/w845-h634-no/IMG_20140622_140932.jpg"/></p>
<h3>Bicycles</h3>
<p>I'd be very happy if we had in London half of the cycling paths we saw in Amsterdam. And it would be so cool if didn't live 12 miles away from the office... and if people here wouldn't drive in the wrong side. But that's a different story.</p>

<h3>The weather</h3>
<p>Like Matus said, <em>we don't realise how lucky we've been with the weather</em> – or did we? Luckily enough, I was able to wear shorts every day and get some human being colour in my forehead. Which unfortunately, will run away during the following weeks.</p>

<h3>Wildlife</h3>
<p>It must be hard to believe when someone tells you he <em>saw several turtles on a tree, in Amsterdam</em>. Well, here's the proof. In top of this, add swans, ducks, several types of pidgeon-like birds, and maybe, an octopus – that's a joke from the trip.</p>

<p>I'd also mention our hostel, but since it was closer to a prison cell, I'll better skip it.</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>I'll close the post here before getting into more detail, because I don't even know how legal or politically correct would be to write about it. I'll only say it's been awesome and I'll try to repeat the experience</p></div>
