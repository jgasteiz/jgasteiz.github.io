<div class="blog-post__content"><p>It's been ten months – minus two days – since the last time I wrote anything here. A lot of stuff has happened in these last 10 months and I'm going to summarise all of it in a list:</p>
<ul>
<li>I went to Japan with Magda for my honeymoon. It was amazing, although it would have been even better if I could have understood some Japanese.</li>
<li>We tried going back to Spain for New Year's Eve, but our flight got cancelled. We made the best of the situation and at least we enjoyed a delicious dinner and a couple of very peaceful days at home.</li>
<li>I started taking film pictures and developing my own film.</li>
<li>I spent a few weeks improving my iOS and Android skills. And I had a lot of fun.</li>
<li>I stopped taking film pictures and developing my own film.</li>
<li>I went to San Francisco for Google IO 2017. I started playing with Kotlin, the new language announced for Android. I'd love to be able to use it at a professional level. Perhaps one of these days?</li>
<li>My niece was born! :) She's great, but I won't be posting pictures of her online.</li>
<li>Magda took me to Brugges for our anniversary. SO. MUCH. BEER. EVERYWHERE. We were incredibly lucky with the weather and I can't stress enough how much I liked Belgium.</li>
<li>Generally, I've increased the load of comics I read since Christmas. I've caught up with a lot of series I started a few years ago – <em>Y: The Last Man</em>, <em>The Walking Dead</em>, <em>Saga</em> – and I've started following many series. I might write about some of them in the future.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'll try to force myself to write at least once or twice a month from now one, at least short posts.</p>
<p>PS: the reason I've decided to bring this back to life is this morning I got charged $6 by Digital Ocean and I felt bad I wasn't doing anything productive with my server! This is a start.</p></div>
