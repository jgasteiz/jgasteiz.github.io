<div class="blog-post__content"><p>Yes, I also thought this blog was dead. It's not like I didn't have anything to write about, I've actually done a lot of things during these last five months. I don't really have an excuse for not writing.</p>
<p>Remembering all the stuff will be easier with the help of some pictures, so here it goes.</p>
<h3>September</h3>
<p>The first half of September was so quiet, the second half was a complete madness to compensate. During exactly 2 weeks, I spent the first five days in Poland – my first Polish wedding – and the last ten in the USA, with Potato.</p>
<p><img alt="vodka" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-N7NRbsHI0hs/VNETyDUzdFI/AAAAAAAATKo/ct1tktLs04I/w800-h533-no/IMG_6419-sm.jpg"/></p>
<p><em>Dancing and sweating is as important as drinking during a Polish wedding, if not more.</em></p>
<p><img alt="drugs" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-cHIDnI1rp3Y/VB_mUDfESpI/AAAAAAAAQhA/8hIQakrSRd8/w837-h628-no/IMG_20140919_214744.jpg"/></p>
<p><em>And because vodka was really good quality, this wasn't really necessary.</em></p>
<p>The Potato offsite went over all expectations. This year there was not only one destination, but three: Santa Monica, Las Vegas and Palm Springs, in that order. The first stop offered a good balance of party possibilities, beach and relax. Vegas was a big rollercoaster to our bodies and brains. And Palm Springs was probably the only possible way we had to calm ourselves down before coming back.</p>
<p>Pics!</p>

<p><em>Party Bus - getting on any bus hasn't been the same since then.</em></p>

<p><em>Yes.</em></p>

<p><em>Palm Springs, such a nice desertic views.</em></p>
<p>With a few extra pounds in our bellies and a <em>never-seen-before</em> jet lag, I somehow manage to start working on my second day back in London.</p>
<h3>October</h3>
<p>Pretty much nothing here. The offsite left my brain half dead for 80% of the month and the only thing I remember from this month is the Halloween pumpkins we carved.</p>
<p><img alt="Pumpkins" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Zvj_gnj35Sw/VEvihnJMk3I/AAAAAAAARMw/aB_Gi9R_5B8/w1118-h628-no/IMG_20141025_184839911.jpg"/></p>
<h3>November</h3>
<p>This is when I start feeling interested in unconventional literature.</p>
<p><img alt="what if?" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-8-EcD2qjv80/VFi5GXoWVjI/AAAAAAAARZk/saTQbdkgtLc/w471-h628-no/IMG_20141104_113132.jpg"/></p>
<p><em>Back cover of Randall Munroe's <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/What-If-Scientific-Hypothetical-Questions/dp/1848549571/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1422988960&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=what+if%3F">"what if?"</a>.</em></p>
<p>I also added other titles to my library such as <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Diary-Edward-Hamster-1990/dp/075222803X">"Diary of Edward the hamster"</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Terrible-Estate-Agent-Photos-Donaldson/dp/0224100912/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1422988914&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Terrible+estate+agent+photos">"Terrible estate agent photos"</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Film-Five-Seconds-Great-Moments/dp/1848662963">"Film in five seconds"</a>.</p>
<p>And finally some friends decide to make me a visit in London!</p>

<h3>December</h3>
<p>Mostly Christmas. It's everywhere. Also, I start getting my hands seriously dirty with Android and Arduino. I publish a couple of (still very simple) apps in the Play Store, which made me spend a lot of spare time learning Android. And most important! I'll get married on June 2016 (yes, 2016, still a year and a half to go) :) Yes, I've deliberately hidden this info here so only friends will actually notice it – who else would read this post anyway?</p>

<p><em>Pretty shite right now, but this app in particular stays as simple as I need it for my daily usage.</em></p>

<p><em>Jesus C.</em></p>
<h3>January</h3>
<p>Back in Vitoria for 10 days. There's Jamón and Chorizo everywhere, such a porky paradise. As usual during Christmas, I get to see all those people I only see once a year.</p>
<p><img alt="Friends" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-UYYap5uc6ok/VKkWVgECfTI/AAAAAAAASeQ/9cbZ6NFiLjw/w837-h628-no/IMG_20150103_224840.jpg"/></p>
<p>And finally, I get back to London to find out my flat electricity is totally screwed. This is the hole they dug in front of my flat.</p>

<span class="blog-post__date">Sunday, 17 August 2014</span>
</div>
<div class="blog-post__content"><p>I'm back to London after a great (and a bit deserved) holiday around the Basque Country and Spain for ten days. It could have been more, but it's been enough to rest and forget about routine, I think.</p>
<p>The trip begins and ends in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitoria_Gasteiz">Vitoria-Gasteiz</a>, my hometown. We arrive in the middle of <a href="http://englishidiotabroad.blogspot.co.uk/2007/10/spain-11-fiestas-de-la-virgen-blanca-4.html">Fiestas de la Blanca</a>. We were lucky enough to see my friends <a href="http://countach.bandcamp.com/">Countach</a> playing live!</p>
<p><img alt="Countach live" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-lkHRYIokv88/U-QW9qyW3uI/AAAAAAAAP-M/La48nKdeA48/w845-h634-no/IMG_20140807_205257.jpg"/></p>
<p>The next day we need to get up soon because we're <strong>blusas</strong> for a day. I used to do this for the entire festivity years ago, but since I moved to London it's not a easy to do as it used to be - it would require getting 5 days of holiday plus a few extra days only for recorvery.</p>
<p><img alt="bereziak" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-C2nQnSAtjio/VNAAYZPPD_I/AAAAAAAAS1Q/GarY3Nh3pXU/w779-h584-no/10622808_10204645513642294_2612904941625119942_n.jpg"/></p>

<p>And <a href="https://plus.google.com/+JaviManzano/posts/Xka8jzx7jBW?pid=6048524182394566594&amp;oid=104971241169939266087">an extra video</a> to show the general mood of that morning.</p>
<p>The weather wasn't the best I've seen there during August, but we managed to stay out of rain for the entire holiday.</p>
<p><img alt="Garaio" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-aFiW9Lb7NaU/U-lHKlR7tzI/AAAAAAAAQGI/v_bb0-lVhSs/w1117-h397-no/IMG_20140811_181657758.jpg"/></p>
<p>After a quick visit to Donostia-San Sebastian, we moved south to Molacillos (Zamora), the village where my father was raised. Chorizo, cheese, red wine and jamón were part of the spanish therapy we got there. Exquisite way of getting rid of stress.</p>
<p>The holiday is getting to an end and we want to say goodbye the proper way, with a massive BBQ with all my friends. We got so much food for lunch, we had dinner with the leftovers. And we still got bread left for today's breakfast.</p>

<h1 class="blog-post__title"><a href="amsterdam-june-2014.html">Amsterdam - June 2014</a></h1>
<span class="blog-post__date">Monday, 23 June 2014</span>
</div>
<div class="blog-post__content"><p>I'm back (alive!) from Amsterdam. A few weeks ago, some friends and I decided it could be fun to spend a weekend partying and discovering the city of Amsterdam. And it's been great.</p>
<h3>The canals</h3>
<p>One of the things people are scared about when they go with this kind of purposes to Amsterdam is falling to the canals. I'm not aware if that's something that happens often, but it didn't happen to us. And I have to say they give a beautiful look to the city.</p>
<p><img alt="The canals" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-tjGhma4btMU/U6dq0X3duDI/AAAAAAAAPfM/LeszwHXrNAg/w845-h634-no/IMG_20140622_140932.jpg"/></p>
<h3>Bicycles</h3>
<p>I'd be very happy if we had in London half of the cycling paths we saw in Amsterdam. And it would be so cool if didn't live 12 miles away from the office... and if people here wouldn't drive in the wrong side. But that's a different story.</p>
<p><img alt="Bicycles" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-H5gg4xw_QvQ/U6dqd600GsI/AAAAAAAAPeo/-h1NOoJ8a-Y/w845-h634-no/IMG_20140622_124530.jpg"/></p>
<h3>The weather</h3>
<p>Like Matus said, <em>we don't realise how lucky we've been with the weather</em> – or did we? Luckily enough, I was able to wear shorts every day and get some human being colour in my forehead. Which unfortunately, will run away during the following weeks.</p>
<p><img alt="The weather" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-4G-XREQfvP8/U6gI3CAqANI/AAAAAAAAPg4/bQ5eCXWvSj4/w845-h634-no/IMG_20140622_195314.jpg"/></p>
<h3>Wildlife</h3>
<p>It must be hard to believe when someone tells you he <em>saw several turtles on a tree, in Amsterdam</em>. Well, here's the proof. In top of this, add swans, ducks, several types of pidgeon-like birds, and maybe, an octopus – that's a joke from the trip.</p>
<p><img alt="Wildlife" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-bPw_hCFRess/U6ifDwgk-3I/AAAAAAAAPiM/StcdWdzkGyY/w786-h590-no/IMG_20140622_171055.jpg"/></p>
<p>I'd also mention our hostel, but since it was closer to a prison cell, I'll better skip it.</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>I'll close the post here before getting into more detail, because I don't even know how legal or politically correct would be to write about it. I'll only say it's been awesome and I'll try to repeat the experience</p></div>
