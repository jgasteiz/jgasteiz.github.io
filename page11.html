<p>Two weeks ago, actually. After almost three weeks in Poland, we're finally back home. I have to say I've missed it a bit. It's been great taking so many days off, being with friends and family and taking days off in general. But it's been hectic. We haven't really stopped doing things for a single day until now.</p>
<p>So, what's like being married? Not much has changed, really. Magda has now a new surname, but that's mostly it.</p>
<p>It's hard to believe how things used to be 30 years ago. My parents, for instance, weren't living together before getting married. Which means they didn't know how life together was going to be until after getting married, such a commitment! Our thing is easy, Magda and I have been living together for almost 3 years now, we (kind of) knew what we were doing.</p>
<p>We decided we wouldn't go on our honeymoon straight after the wedding, but a few months after, to Japan. I'm really looking forward to it. Now we <em>only</em> have to start organising the trip!</p>
<p>Anyway, I leave you a couple of pictures we took the week after the wedding. Thanks to Magda's cousin for taking them!</p>

<p>Last Wednesday I got good news at <a href="https://p.ota.to">Potato</a>: I've been promoted to senior developer :)</p>
<p>It's been roughly a year since I decided to ask for more responsibilities at work - tech leading small things at first, big ones until now - and it seems I've been doing things well (or so I've been told).</p>
<p>The reason I decided to ask for it was that I was going to get more variety of work than if I decided to stay the way I was. Which wasn't bad, but most of the times I felt like I wasn't being challenged and I really thought I could do more. Since then I've been lucky enough to work on Android and Arduino related stuff, tech lead a couple of short projects and more recently being the tech lead of a big team (oscillating between 6 and 8 people).</p>
<p>I think I could have got the promotion a bit earlier if I had pushed for it a bit more, but I really didn't want to rush it. Rushing it would have meant forcing myself to learn things faster and I think this is one of those things it's better learnt slowly.</p>
<p>The main difference I've noticed during the last year is that I now have to deal with people much more than I used to: people will ask you questions which answers you won't always know and figuring out how to solve these situations is, most of the times, a lot of fun.</p></div>

<p>For the last few months I haven't been coding much in my spare time. Not
necessarily a bad thing though, I've been enjoying other aspects of life (videogames, movies, etc.).</p>
<p>However, I felt it's been a long while since I wrote some Python for a
personal project, so I've decided to write a simple static site generator
in Python - yes, I know about Pelican, I've used it in the past.</p>
<h3>Why?</h3>
<p>No particular reason, but if I had to come up with one, I'd say I want to
work on a simple problem, such as generating an static html site, that
will make me come up with a solution without checking how other static
site generators work. Just for fun.</p>
<p>Also, I've been re-reading SMACSS recently and I wanted to apply some
of the knowledge before I forget about it.</p>
<h3>Technology that will be used</h3>
<ul>
<li>Python 3</li>
<li>Markdown</li>
<li>BeautifulSoup 4</li>
</ul>
