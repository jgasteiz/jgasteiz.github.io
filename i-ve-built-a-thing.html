<div class="blog-post__content"><p>I like reading comics and for the last couple of years I've been reading and collecting a bunch of them – can't wait for the next time I change flats, yay. Because the idea of moving flats terrorises me, I've often thought about moving to digital and stop buying paper comics. But I can't, I really like to feel the physical books on my hands. I suspect that in a few years, when big sized tablets such as the iPad Pro 12" become affordable, I might make a full move to digital. But until then, it's all about paper.</p>
<p>Something I've realised though is that once I own the physical comic book and I've read it, I don't really mind too much re-reading or looking at it digitally. So a few months ago I came with the idea of digitalising my entire comic library. I'm doing this for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>I want to be able to access all my comics in any way I like, at the best possible quality (I'm looking at you, Comixology), from any device I like. Because they are mine!</li>
<li>I want to <em>unrust</em> my Android and iOS skills.</li>
<li>I want to give some use to my Raspberry PI 3.</li>
<li>I'm curious about the technical challenge all of this represents.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Stage 1 - Collect all the comics</h2>
<p>The first thing I need in order to create a digital comic library is the content: digital copies of my comic books. Finding most of them online isn't hard, but some of them represent a challenge: I have some Spanish comic books that have never been digitalized, so I've had to find their English versions instead.</p>
<p>Apart from my physical library, I also have a big number of comics on Comixology: mainly the ones that I don't really mind not having on paper because I only want to read them and I don't want them to take space on my shelve or perhaps because Comixology had an amazing sale, which unfortunately for my wallet, happens often.</p>
<p>It has taken me weeks to get to a point where I have the same content in both bookshelves, digital and physical, but I get finally get there – almost actually, still missing a few.</p>

<h2>Stage 2 - Put it on the local network</h2>
<p>For that, I've got a NAS that I've connected to the internet router. A 2TB WD My Cloud does the job. After putting all the digital comics on the network hard drive, a quick test to make sure this will be accessible on my local network, it works!</p>

<h2>Stage 3 - Raspberry PI 3</h2>
<p>Not complicating myself with this one. I've installed <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/">Raspbian Stretch Lite</a> which does the local server job perfectly fine. Also installed <a href="https://www.nginx.com/">NGINX</a> as a web server.</p>

<h2>Stage 4 - The apps</h2>
<p>This is by far what has taken longer of them all. I've had to build 3 different apps to get this stuff working.</p>
<ol>
<li>A Django app which works as a server for delivering the directories with comics and the individual pages of each comic when reading them. The code can be found <a href="https://github.com/jgasteiz/comic-reader-home">here</a>. For reading the comics, I've used React because I wanted a quick way of giving the API a test before writing the native apps.</li>
<li>An Android app which works as a client and connects to the Django API and lets me read my digital comics. I've recently added "offline" reading, so I can download my comics when I'm at home and read them anywhere I like. It works fairly decently, but I want to improve the downloading bit - currently blocking the main UI thread a bit when showing the "download progress". The code can be found <a href="https://github.com/jgasteiz/comic-reader-home-android">here</a>.</li>
<li>An iOS app I started building and it's almost there! I can already browse the folders and read a comic, but I need to work more on the page zooming and navigation. I also need to add the offline mode to this one. The code can be found <a href="https://github.com/jgasteiz/comic-reader-home-ios">here</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Now, some screenshots of how the apps look like</strong></p>

<h2>Final thoughts and moral concerns</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, in order to get digital copies of some of my comic books I've had to <em>obtain them</em> from dark places on the internet – I'm sorry, but after spending £30 on a heavy and nice hardcover comic book, I'm not going to spend £20 on its digital version. Some others, especially a lot of the Image ones, I've been able to get through amazing sales on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/">Humble Bundle</a> (in this case I've actually bought some comics twice) and I've been able to get some others from the Comixology "backup" option they offer on some comics - not on many though.</p>
<p>Marvel and DC have been doing something pretty cool during the last year or so: when you buy a paper issue, some of them will come with a "code" that will unlock that same comic book on the digital comics platform Comixology. That's great and I hope others like Image, Dark Horse, Dynamite, etc. will start doing the same at some point. I really prefer reading them on paper, but I also enjoy re-reading some of them digitally because the colours look so great on a screen.</p>
<p>All that said, my conscience is clean because I know I've spent honest money on supporting the artists, editors, distributors and librarians by buying <strong>a lot</strong> of paper comics from many, many comic shops.</p>
<p>Finally, I didn't want to finish this blog post without actually showing how my physical bookshelves look like: <a href="https://imgur.com/a/NNjBo">Bookshelves</a>. You can probably see I'm running out of space. Well, that actually happened a few months ago already, so I've been moving some of the oldest stuff that I don't really look at anymore to a long box. I'll probably need to get a second long box soon.</p>
<p>PS: Buy comics. Support the artists, editors, distributors, librarians and everyone who takes part in the process of bringing this great art to you.</p></div>
