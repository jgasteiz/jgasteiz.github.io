<div class="blog-post__content"><p>Last Wednesday I got good news at <a href="https://p.ota.to">Potato</a>: I've been promoted to senior developer :)</p>
<p>It's been roughly a year since I decided to ask for more responsibilities at work - tech leading small things at first, big ones until now - and it seems I've been doing things well (or so I've been told).</p>
<p>The reason I decided to ask for it was that I was going to get more variety of work than if I decided to stay the way I was. Which wasn't bad, but most of the times I felt like I wasn't being challenged and I really thought I could do more. Since then I've been lucky enough to work on Android and Arduino related stuff, tech lead a couple of short projects and more recently being the tech lead of a big team (oscillating between 6 and 8 people).</p>
<p>I think I could have got the promotion a bit earlier if I had pushed for it a bit more, but I really didn't want to rush it. Rushing it would have meant forcing myself to learn things faster and I think this is one of those things it's better learnt slowly.</p>
<p>The main difference I've noticed during the last year is that I now have to deal with people much more than I used to: people will ask you questions which answers you won't always know and figuring out how to solve these situations is, most of the times, a lot of fun.</p></div>

<div class="blog-post__content"><p>For the last few months I haven't been coding much in my spare time. Not
necessarily a bad thing though, I've been enjoying other aspects of life (videogames, movies, etc.).</p>
<p>However, I felt it's been a long while since I wrote some Python for a
personal project, so I've decided to write a simple static site generator
in Python - yes, I know about Pelican, I've used it in the past.</p>
<h3>Why?</h3>
<p>No particular reason, but if I had to come up with one, I'd say I want to
work on a simple problem, such as generating an static html site, that
will make me come up with a solution without checking how other static
site generators work. Just for fun.</p>
<p>Also, I've been re-reading SMACSS recently and I wanted to apply some
of the knowledge before I forget about it.</p>
<h3>Technology that will be used</h3>
<ul>
<li>Python 3</li>
<li>Markdown</li>
<li>BeautifulSoup 4</li>
</ul>
<h3>Code available here</h3>

<div class="blog-post__content"><p>In the past few months I've noticed I'm barely able to write anything on a paper. My calligraphy has gone to shit since I left uni and at this pace I'm going to have to relearn how to write.</p>
<p>The only thing I've been able to come up with to avoid that is to start having a pocket todo diary, instead of using Todoist (sorry, Todoist). Hopefully, by writing a bit every day I will soon remember how to do it.</p>
<p>I guess this is a classic 21st century problem.</p></div>
