<div class="blog-post__content"><p>Date: 2018-03-08</p>
<p>I like reading comics and for the last couple of years I've been reading and collecting a bunch of them – can't wait for the next time I change flats, yay. Because the idea of moving flats terrorises me, I've often thought about moving to digital and stop buying paper comics. But I can't, I really like to feel the physical books on my hands. I suspect that in a few years, when big sized tablets such as the iPad Pro 12" become affordable, I might make a full move to digital. But until then, it's all about paper.</p>
<p>Something I've realised though is that once I own the physical comic book and I've read it, I don't really mind too much re-reading or looking at it digitally. So a few months ago I came with the idea of digitalising my entire comic book collection. I'm doing this for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>I want to be able to access all my comics in any way I like, at the best possible quality (I'm looking at you, Comixology), from any device I like. Because they are mine!</li>
<li>I want to <em>unrust</em> my Android and iOS skills.</li>
<li>I want to give some use to my Raspberry Pi 3.</li>
<li>I'm curious about the technical challenge all of this represents.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Stage 1 - Collect all the comics</h2>
<p>The first thing I need in order to create a digital comic book library is its content: digital copies of my comic books. Finding most of them online isn't hard, but getting some of them is plainly impossible: I have some Spanish comic books that have never been digitalized, so I've had to find their English versions instead. And no, I won't scan them myself.</p>
<p>Apart from my physical library, I also have a big number of comics on Comixology: mainly the ones that I don't really mind not having on paper because I don't care too much about them or perhaps because Comixology has had an amazing sale, which unfortunately for my wallet, happens often.</p>
<p>It has taken me weeks to get to a point where I have almost the same content in both bookshelves, digital and physical.</p>
<h2>Stage 2 - Put it on the local network</h2>
<p>For that, I've acquired a NAS that I've connected to my local network. A 2TB WD My Cloud does the job.</p>
<p><img alt="Imgur" src="https://i.imgur.com/KLdQr5x.jpg"/></p>
<p>After putting all the digital comics on the network hard drive, a quick test to make sure this will be accessible on my local network, it works!</p>
<p><img alt="Imgur" src="https://i.imgur.com/Z0HWNnQ.png"/></p>
<h2>Stage 3 - The apps</h2>
<p>This has taken longer than the other "stages". I've built 3 different apps to get everything working the way I like:</p>
<ol>
<li>A Django app which works as a server for delivering the directories with comics and the individual pages of each comic when reading them. The code can be found <a href="https://github.com/jgasteiz/comic-reader-home">here</a>. I've built the actual "comic reading app" using React, because I wanted a quick way of giving the API a test before writing the native apps and it has turned out to be a very simple solution to the problem of having to write a web comic reader. I'm also using Django Rest Framework for putting together a very simple API to serve individual comic pages.</li>
<li>An Android app which works as a client and connects to the Django API and lets me read my digital comics. I've recently added "offline" reading, so I can download my comics when I'm at home and read them anywhere I like. It works fairly well, but I want to improve the "downloading" feature - I'm updating the UI too much showing the download progress on the main thread, looking into writing a service for dealing with that. The code can be found <a href="https://github.com/jgasteiz/comic-reader-home-android">here</a>.</li>
<li>I've also started writing an iOS app, which is almost done now! I can already browse the folders and read a comic, but the reader definitely needs more love. Zooming and page browsing is not there yet. I also need to add the offline mode to this one. The code can be found <a href="https://github.com/jgasteiz/comic-reader-home-ios">here</a>.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Stage 4 - Setting up the Raspberry Pi 3</h2>
<p>Simple, cheap and way more powerful than the Raspberry Pi 2 (which I also have lying around).</p>
<p>A few details on what I'm running here:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/">Raspbian Stretch Lite</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.nginx.com/">NGINX</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/">RabbitMQ</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.celeryproject.org/">Celery</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jgasteiz/comic-reader-home">The django app mentioned in Stage 3</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The only thing I need to do for this to work is mount the network drive on a local directory and point the <code>comic-reader-home</code> app to that location.</p>

<h2>Final thoughts and moral concerns</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, in order to get digital copies of some of my comic books I've had to <em>obtain them</em> from dark places on the internet – I'm sorry, but after spending £30 on a heavy and nice hardcover comic book, I'm not going to spend £20 on its digital version. Some others, especially a lot of the Image ones, I've been able to get through amazing sales on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/">Humble Bundle</a> (in this case I've actually bought some comics twice) and I've been able to get some others from the Comixology "backup" option they offer on some comics - not on many though.</p>
<p>Marvel and DC have been doing something pretty cool during the last year or so: when you buy a paper issue, some of them will come with a "code" that will unlock that same comic book on the digital comics platform Comixology. That's great and I hope others like Image, Dark Horse, Dynamite, etc. will start doing the same at some point. I really prefer reading them on paper, but I also enjoy re-reading some of them digitally because the colours look so great on a screen.</p>
<p>All that said, my conscience is clean because I know I've spent honest money on supporting the artists, editors, distributors and librarians by buying <strong>a lot</strong> of paper comics from many, many comic shops.</p>
<p>Finally, I didn't want to finish this blog post without actually showing how my actual collection look like: </p>
<p><img alt="Bookshelves 1" src="https://i.imgur.com/vZdFGB3.jpg"/></p>
<p><img alt="Bookshelves 2" src="https://i.imgur.com/eWNfKLC.jpg"/></p>
<p><img alt="Bookshelves 3" src="https://i.imgur.com/E0YydQb.jpg"/></p>
<p>(Yes, I know it's all a bit chaotic)</p>
<p>PS: Buy comics. Support the artists, editors, distributors, librarians and everyone who takes part in the process of bringing this great art to you.</p></div>

<p>It's been ten months – minus two days – since the last time I wrote anything here. A lot of stuff has happened in these last 10 months and I'm going to summarise all of it in a list:</p>
<ul>
<li>I went to Japan with Magda for my honeymoon. It was amazing, although it would have been even better if I could have understood some Japanese.</li>
<li>We tried going back to Spain for New Year's Eve, but our flight got cancelled. We made the best of the situation and at least we enjoyed a delicious dinner and a couple of very peaceful days at home.</li>
<li>I started taking film pictures and developing my own film.</li>
<li>I spent a few weeks improving my iOS and Android skills. And I had a lot of fun.</li>
<li>I stopped taking film pictures and developing my own film.</li>
<li>I went to San Francisco for Google IO 2017. I started playing with Kotlin, the new language announced for Android. I'd love to be able to use it at a professional level. Perhaps one of these days?</li>
<li>My niece was born! :) She's great, but I won't be posting pictures of her online.</li>
<li>Magda took me to Brugges for our anniversary. SO. MUCH. BEER. EVERYWHERE. We were incredibly lucky with the weather and I can't stress enough how much I liked Belgium.</li>
<li>Generally, I've increased the load of comics I read since Christmas. I've caught up with a lot of series I started a few years ago – <em>Y: The Last Man</em>, <em>The Walking Dead</em>, <em>Saga</em> – and I've started following many series. I might write about some of them in the future.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'll try to force myself to write at least once or twice a month from now one, at least short posts.</p>
<p>PS: the reason I've decided to bring this back to life is this morning I got charged $6 by Digital Ocean and I felt bad I wasn't doing anything productive with my server! This is a start.</p></div>
