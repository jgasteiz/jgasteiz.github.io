<div class="blog-post__content"><p>Yes, I also thought this blog was dead. It's not like I didn't have anything to write about, I've actually done a lot of things during these last five months. I don't really have an excuse for not writing.</p>
<p>Remembering all the stuff will be easier with the help of some pictures, so here it goes.</p>
<h3>September</h3>
<p>The first half of September was so quiet, the second half was a complete madness to compensate. During exactly 2 weeks, I spent the first five days in Poland – my first Polish wedding – and the last ten in the USA, with Potato.</p>
<p><img alt="vodka" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-N7NRbsHI0hs/VNETyDUzdFI/AAAAAAAATKo/ct1tktLs04I/w800-h533-no/IMG_6419-sm.jpg"/></p>
<p><em>Dancing and sweating is as important as drinking during a Polish wedding, if not more.</em></p>
<p><img alt="drugs" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-cHIDnI1rp3Y/VB_mUDfESpI/AAAAAAAAQhA/8hIQakrSRd8/w837-h628-no/IMG_20140919_214744.jpg"/></p>
<p><em>And because vodka was really good quality, this wasn't really necessary.</em></p>
<p>The Potato offsite went over all expectations. This year there was not only one destination, but three: Santa Monica, Las Vegas and Palm Springs, in that order. The first stop offered a good balance of party possibilities, beach and relax. Vegas was a big rollercoaster to our bodies and brains. And Palm Springs was probably the only possible way we had to calm ourselves down before coming back.</p>

<p><em>Party Bus - getting on any bus hasn't been the same since then.</em></p>

<p><em>Yes.</em></p>
<p><img alt="Palm Springs" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-uAO75VUmagY/VCl9lISpceI/AAAAAAAAQ9o/NkI38s0yczI/w1118-h628-no/IMG_20140928_092248964.jpg"/></p>
<p><em>Palm Springs, such a nice desertic views.</em></p>
<p>With a few extra pounds in our bellies and a <em>never-seen-before</em> jet lag, I somehow manage to start working on my second day back in London.</p>
<h3>October</h3>
<p>Pretty much nothing here. The offsite left my brain half dead for 80% of the month and the only thing I remember from this month is the Halloween pumpkins we carved.</p>
<p><img alt="Pumpkins" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Zvj_gnj35Sw/VEvihnJMk3I/AAAAAAAARMw/aB_Gi9R_5B8/w1118-h628-no/IMG_20141025_184839911.jpg"/></p>
<h3>November</h3>
<p>This is when I start feeling interested in unconventional literature.</p>
<p><img alt="what if?" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-8-EcD2qjv80/VFi5GXoWVjI/AAAAAAAARZk/saTQbdkgtLc/w471-h628-no/IMG_20141104_113132.jpg"/></p>
<p><em>Back cover of Randall Munroe's <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/What-If-Scientific-Hypothetical-Questions/dp/1848549571/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1422988960&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=what+if%3F">"what if?"</a>.</em></p>
<p>I also added other titles to my library such as <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Diary-Edward-Hamster-1990/dp/075222803X">"Diary of Edward the hamster"</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Terrible-Estate-Agent-Photos-Donaldson/dp/0224100912/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1422988914&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Terrible+estate+agent+photos">"Terrible estate agent photos"</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Film-Five-Seconds-Great-Moments/dp/1848662963">"Film in five seconds"</a>.</p>
<p>And finally some friends decide to make me a visit in London!</p>

<h3>December</h3>
<p>Mostly Christmas. It's everywhere. Also, I start getting my hands seriously dirty with Android and Arduino. I publish a couple of (still very simple) apps in the Play Store, which made me spend a lot of spare time learning Android. And most important! I'll get married on June 2016 (yes, 2016, still a year and a half to go) :) Yes, I've deliberately hidden this info here so only friends will actually notice it – who else would read this post anyway?</p>

<p><em>Pretty shite right now, but this app in particular stays as simple as I need it for my daily usage.</em></p>

<p><em>Jesus C.</em></p>
<h3>January</h3>
<p>Back in Vitoria for 10 days. There's Jamón and Chorizo everywhere, such a porky paradise. As usual during Christmas, I get to see all those people I only see once a year.</p>
<p><img alt="Friends" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-UYYap5uc6ok/VKkWVgECfTI/AAAAAAAASeQ/9cbZ6NFiLjw/w837-h628-no/IMG_20150103_224840.jpg"/></p>
<p>And finally, I get back to London to find out my flat electricity is totally screwed. This is the hole they dug in front of my flat.</p>
