<div class="blog-post__content"><p>I'm back here since this Monday morning, that's one of the few and vague reasons I haven't written in a few days. That and Christmas excitement. New year's eve has been brutal this year. I can't remember a night as epic as this year's has been, hard to believe. Specially because I don't usually enjoy new year's eve at all.</p>
<p>I brought the new camera to Spain and I've some time to spend learning the basics about it. After reading some book introductions and blog posts, I've got a common message from all of them: I should try to make tons of pictures. Apparently "learning by doing" is the best way of learning. Good stuff. I've also started uploading some of them to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jgasteiz/">my flickr account</a>.</p>
<p><em>A couple of seconds of shutter speed in the darkness of my bedroom made the trick.</em></p>

<p><em>After reading one of the first chapters of <a href="http://www.ppsop.com/unex.aspx">Understanding Exposure, by Bryan Peterson</a>, I had the feeling of trying something the book explained about playing with values for getting cool exposures. For getting this, I've also changed some stuff in Lightroom.</em></p>

<p>A tripod was used for both pictures, I got a cheap one the other day - I know, I know, none recommends cheap tripods. But I'm definitely not spending a lot on a tripod now, and 12 euros seemed quite reasonable for what I got. Better that than nothing, right?</p>
<p>And that's all folks.</p></div>

<div class="blog-post__content"><p>Funny moment when you are watching a science fiction movie and you realise a guy - William Fichtner - who is doing some work on his computer is actually programming assembler. Nice one, but taking into account the story is set in 2154, it seems a bit too much.</p>

<p>I just can't help stopping a movie I'm watching everytime I see a scene in which someone is typing something. I'm always looking forward to finding stuff like this.</p></div>
