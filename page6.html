<div class="blog-post__content"><p>Date: 2019-11-18</p>
<p>Last weekend I've been visiting Cologne and there <em>happened</em> to be an art exhibition about Moebius in a town nearby (just joking, this was no accident).</p>
<p>Moebius was Jean Giraud's artist name, who was born in France in 1938 and passed away on 2012. If you like European comic, you have probably heard of him, but if you haven't, he's mainly known for:
- Blueberry, in my opinion the best western ever made.
- Metal Hurlant / Heavy Metal magazine, where he started most of his sci-fi work.
- The Incal, a sci-fi series written by A. Jodorowsky.
- A lot of collaborations and design work for the movie industry, to mention a few names: The Fifth Element, Tron, Alien, Jodorowsky's Dune (which unfortunately never happened, but his designs inspired other movies).</p>
<p>Here are some of the best pictures I took at the exhibition.</p>

<h1 class="blog-post__title"><a href="2018-03-08-i-ve-built-a-thing.html">I've built a thing</a></h1>
<span class="blog-post__date">Thursday, 08 March 2018</span>
</div>
<div class="blog-post__content"><p>Date: 2018-03-08</p>
<p>I like reading comics and for the last couple of years I've been reading and collecting a bunch of them – can't wait for the next time I change flats, yay. Because the idea of moving flats terrorises me, I've often thought about moving to digital and stop buying paper comics. But I can't, I really like to feel the physical books on my hands. I suspect that in a few years, when big sized tablets such as the iPad Pro 12" become affordable, I might make a full move to digital. But until then, it's all about paper.</p>
<p>Something I've realised though is that once I own the physical comic book and I've read it, I don't really mind too much re-reading or looking at it digitally. So a few months ago I came with the idea of digitalising my entire comic book collection. I'm doing this for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>I want to be able to access all my comics in any way I like, at the best possible quality (I'm looking at you, Comixology), from any device I like. Because they are mine!</li>
<li>I want to <em>unrust</em> my Android and iOS skills.</li>
<li>I want to give some use to my Raspberry Pi 3.</li>
<li>I'm curious about the technical challenge all of this represents.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Stage 1 - Collect all the comics</h2>
<p>The first thing I need in order to create a digital comic book library is its content: digital copies of my comic books. Finding most of them online isn't hard, but getting some of them is plainly impossible: I have some Spanish comic books that have never been digitalized, so I've had to find their English versions instead. And no, I won't scan them myself.</p>
<p>Apart from my physical library, I also have a big number of comics on Comixology: mainly the ones that I don't really mind not having on paper because I don't care too much about them or perhaps because Comixology has had an amazing sale, which unfortunately for my wallet, happens often.</p>
<p>It has taken me weeks to get to a point where I have almost the same content in both bookshelves, digital and physical.</p>
<h2>Stage 2 - Put it on the local network</h2>
<p>For that, I've acquired a NAS that I've connected to my local network. A 2TB WD My Cloud does the job.</p>
<p><img alt="Imgur" src="https://i.imgur.com/KLdQr5x.jpg"/></p>
<p>After putting all the digital comics on the network hard drive, a quick test to make sure this will be accessible on my local network, it works!</p>
<p><img alt="Imgur" src="https://i.imgur.com/Z0HWNnQ.png"/></p>
<h2>Stage 3 - The apps</h2>
<p>This has taken longer than the other "stages". I've built 3 different apps to get everything working the way I like:</p>
<ol>
<li>A Django app which works as a server for delivering the directories with comics and the individual pages of each comic when reading them. The code can be found <a href="https://github.com/jgasteiz/comic-reader-home">here</a>. I've built the actual "comic reading app" using React, because I wanted a quick way of giving the API a test before writing the native apps and it has turned out to be a very simple solution to the problem of having to write a web comic reader. I'm also using Django Rest Framework for putting together a very simple API to serve individual comic pages.</li>
<li>An Android app which works as a client and connects to the Django API and lets me read my digital comics. I've recently added "offline" reading, so I can download my comics when I'm at home and read them anywhere I like. It works fairly well, but I want to improve the "downloading" feature - I'm updating the UI too much showing the download progress on the main thread, looking into writing a service for dealing with that. The code can be found <a href="https://github.com/jgasteiz/comic-reader-home-android">here</a>.</li>
<li>I've also started writing an iOS app, which is almost done now! I can already browse the folders and read a comic, but the reader definitely needs more love. Zooming and page browsing is not there yet. I also need to add the offline mode to this one. The code can be found <a href="https://github.com/jgasteiz/comic-reader-home-ios">here</a>.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Stage 4 - Setting up the Raspberry Pi 3</h2>
<p>Simple, cheap and way more powerful than the Raspberry Pi 2 (which I also have lying around).</p>
<p>A few details on what I'm running here:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/">Raspbian Stretch Lite</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.nginx.com/">NGINX</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/">RabbitMQ</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.celeryproject.org/">Celery</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jgasteiz/comic-reader-home">The django app mentioned in Stage 3</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The only thing I need to do for this to work is mount the network drive on a local directory and point the <code>comic-reader-home</code> app to that location.</p>
<p><img alt="Imgur" src="https://i.imgur.com/YL2LHgC.jpg"/></p>
<p><strong>Now, some screenshots of how the apps look like</strong></p>

<p><img alt="Imgur" src="https://i.imgur.com/AovOzXr.jpg"/></p>
<h2>Final thoughts and moral concerns</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, in order to get digital copies of some of my comic books I've had to <em>obtain them</em> from dark places on the internet – I'm sorry, but after spending £30 on a heavy and nice hardcover comic book, I'm not going to spend £20 on its digital version. Some others, especially a lot of the Image ones, I've been able to get through amazing sales on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/">Humble Bundle</a> (in this case I've actually bought some comics twice) and I've been able to get some others from the Comixology "backup" option they offer on some comics - not on many though.</p>
<p>Marvel and DC have been doing something pretty cool during the last year or so: when you buy a paper issue, some of them will come with a "code" that will unlock that same comic book on the digital comics platform Comixology. That's great and I hope others like Image, Dark Horse, Dynamite, etc. will start doing the same at some point. I really prefer reading them on paper, but I also enjoy re-reading some of them digitally because the colours look so great on a screen.</p>
<p>All that said, my conscience is clean because I know I've spent honest money on supporting the artists, editors, distributors and librarians by buying <strong>a lot</strong> of paper comics from many, many comic shops.</p>
<p>Finally, I didn't want to finish this blog post without actually showing how my actual collection look like: </p>
<p><img alt="Bookshelves 1" src="https://i.imgur.com/vZdFGB3.jpg"/></p>
<p><img alt="Bookshelves 2" src="https://i.imgur.com/eWNfKLC.jpg"/></p>
<p><img alt="Bookshelves 3" src="https://i.imgur.com/E0YydQb.jpg"/></p>
<p>(Yes, I know it's all a bit chaotic)</p>
<p>PS: Buy comics. Support the artists, editors, distributors, librarians and everyone who takes part in the process of bringing this great art to you.</p></div>

<p>It's been ten months – minus two days – since the last time I wrote anything here. A lot of stuff has happened in these last 10 months and I'm going to summarise all of it in a list:</p>
<ul>
<li>I went to Japan with Magda for my honeymoon. It was amazing, although it would have been even better if I could have understood some Japanese.</li>
<li>We tried going back to Spain for New Year's Eve, but our flight got cancelled. We made the best of the situation and at least we enjoyed a delicious dinner and a couple of very peaceful days at home.</li>
<li>I started taking film pictures and developing my own film.</li>
<li>I spent a few weeks improving my iOS and Android skills. And I had a lot of fun.</li>
<li>I stopped taking film pictures and developing my own film.</li>
<li>I went to San Francisco for Google IO 2017. I started playing with Kotlin, the new language announced for Android. I'd love to be able to use it at a professional level. Perhaps one of these days?</li>
<li>My niece was born! :) She's great, but I won't be posting pictures of her online.</li>
<li>Magda took me to Brugges for our anniversary. SO. MUCH. BEER. EVERYWHERE. We were incredibly lucky with the weather and I can't stress enough how much I liked Belgium.</li>
<li>Generally, I've increased the load of comics I read since Christmas. I've caught up with a lot of series I started a few years ago – <em>Y: The Last Man</em>, <em>The Walking Dead</em>, <em>Saga</em> – and I've started following many series. I might write about some of them in the future.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'll try to force myself to write at least once or twice a month from now one, at least short posts.</p>
<p>PS: the reason I've decided to bring this back to life is this morning I got charged $6 by Digital Ocean and I felt bad I wasn't doing anything productive with my server! This is a start.</p></div>

<h1 class="blog-post__title"><a href="2016-10-03-renting-vs-owning-a-car.html">Renting vs Owning a car</a></h1>
<span class="blog-post__date">Monday, 03 October 2016</span>
</div>
<div class="blog-post__content"><p>Date: 2016-10-03</p>
<p>I've just come back from spending a few days in Spain and this time I've decided to rent a car for a few days to avoid the bus-bus-walk-tram combination I'd have to take between the airport and my parents' house.</p>
<p>And now I've realised how much I miss owning a car. I used to have one back in Spain, but it belongs to my mom now.</p>
<p>Owning a car would obviously give me a huge deal of freedom and it would make tasks such as weekly shopping, visiting friends and discovering places around the UK much nicer. But there's a price to pay for that, so I thought I could write a blog post comparing the costs of owning and maintaining a car versus just renting one whenever I need it.</p>
<p><em>For the sake of argument, I'll use a Toyota Yaris as the example car I would buy and a Volkswagen Golf from Zipcar, the most common Zipcar car you can get.</em></p>
<h2>Owning a car</h2>
<p>A quick search on <em>eBay</em> tells me I could get a Toyota Yaris from 2012 for around £6000. I'm not very fuzzy and I would be satisfied with the most basic version.</p>
<p>I've got a quote for how much I'd pay for a comprehensive insurance and it would be around £600 per year.</p>
<h3>Car usage</h3>
<p>We fill the tank once per month for basic usage: shopping once a week, visiting friends in London, etc. It should be around £50 per month.</p>
<p>We also decide to get out of London once a month and we need to add some more petrol to the tank: £25 extra per month should cover that.</p>
<p>We should probably clean the car too: £10 per month.</p>
<p>General maintenance: £200 per year – providing nothing serious has to be dealt with.</p>
<p>And finally, around 3 times per year, we take a long weekend and we go far away from the city. Probably a full tank per trip should cover that: that's £150 for the three long weekends.</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>First year costs: £6,000 initial investment, plus £600 of insurance, plus £1470 for petrol and maintenance: £8,070.</p>
<p>For the next four years, the annual cost should be close to £2,070.</p>
<p>That means the first five years of car usage should be around £16,350. But for sure, something will happen in five years and you'll need to take the car to a garage for something slightly serious. But we're unlucky and we'll have to spend around £3,000 on something unexpected. <strong>That makes a total of £19,350 for the first five years.</strong></p>
<p>Another good thing about buying your own car: you can always sell it when you're bored of it and get some of the initial investment back.</p>
<h2>Renting with Zipcar</h2>
<p>Zipcar allows its users renting cars per hour and per day. That's pretty cool, because you might only need the car for a quick ride to Ikea – although to be honest, rides to Ikea are rarely <em>quick</em> – or a massive shopping you want to do before throwing a party at home.</p>
<p>These are the Zipcar prices for a Volkswagen Golf as of 3rd October 2016:</p>
<ul>
<li>£7/hour and £64/day between Monday and Friday.</li>
<li>£8.5/hour and £75/day on Saturday and Sunday.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Car usage</h3>
<p>Let's say I take a car for 2 hours every Wednesday to do the weekly shopping. That's £14 per shopping – I could actually get it delivered for a couple of pounds but I never know what I need until I'm in the shop and I see it. If I do the shopping every Wednesday of the year, it would cost me £568.</p>
<p>During the weekends, we decide to escape London and visit a small town once a month. It's probably a good idea to get a car for a full day, we don't want to be scrumpy. That's £75. Zipcar also charges you for the extra mileage beyond the included 60 miles. To round it up, let's say we'll spend £100 per month between the extra mileage and the full day rental price.</p>
<p>We also visit some friends in London twice per month during the weekends, that's probably 6 hours of usage: £51.</p>
<p>On top of that, let's add three long weekend holidays per year: that's three full days renting a car, between Friday and Sunday. That would be £214, but let's add £86 on top of each for extra mileage – I always wanted to visit Cornwall and Scotland –, so that's £300 per long weekend.</p>
<p>And finally, we added a comprehensive insurance when buying a car, so we should do the same when renting one. Zipcar all-inclusive insurance costs £20 per month: that's £240 per year. Plus Zipcar membership, which is £60 per year, it becomes £300 per year.</p>
<p>The good thing about Zipcar is the lack of surprises. If you are paying for the comprehensive insurance, it doesn't matter what happens to the car, Zipcar will deal with it.</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The total sum of all these expenses is <strong>£3,580 per year</strong>. And this is probably way above I would ever pay, because I would probably not use it as much as I mentioned above.</p>
<p>There are a couple of remaining gotchas I haven't mentioned about Zipcar:</p>
<ol>
<li>The closest car from your home might not be always available, so you'll have to get around that.</li>
<li>No one delivers the car to your house, you have to go and pick it up – potentially having to take a bus or the tube to get there – and return it to the same spot when you are done with it, on time. It's hard to quantify how much money that would cost – for instance, I have a TFL travel card and it would be "free for me" –, but I can tell you how annoying it is to return the car to its original place after doing the weekly shopping: <strong>very much</strong>. So that's also something to take into account.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<ul>
<li>Five years of owning and maintaining a Toyota Yaris: <strong>£19,350</strong></li>
<li>Five years of using a Zipcar rented car: <strong>£17,900</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>There's not such a big difference! I think it's more likely I'd end up buying a car at some point next year than I'd start using Zipcar as much as I've written above. Grabbing a Zipcar requires some actual commitment and a bit of work: plan the rental hours very well, purchase an insurance – if you want premium cover –, grab the car, drop the car… Owning a car might involve a couple of visits to the garage every year, but apart from that it's mostly a huge brick of convenience parked down your house.</p>
<p>I'll also set a reminder for every year after the date I buy the car, so I can write follow-up blog posts explaining how wrong I was thinking I could actually predict the amount of money I was going to spend on a car and its maintenance.</p></div>
